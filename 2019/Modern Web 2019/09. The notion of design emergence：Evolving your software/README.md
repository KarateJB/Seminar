## Knowledge Creation and Preservation

## When do ou have best knowledge?

- We want to have as much knowledge as possible to make any decision.
- Delay the product, and you delay the FEEDBACK.
- We want the customer breath and use the product early to get feedback and knowledge.
- In Waterfall, they want to make all decisions and and implement the initial design. But its too slow!
- Make it work -> Make it right -> Make it fast.

##

- Erlang/Elixir gives you options to implment quickly to get feedback.
- [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/) can make a service without writing a single line JS.
